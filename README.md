# Team-ITA RocketPy Simulation: 1km Altitude Rocket Project

This repository contains the simulation code for a rocket using the **RocketPy** library. The goal is to predict flight performance, aerodynamic stability, and structural safety for a rocket designed to reach approximately **1 km in altitude** before parachute recovery.
